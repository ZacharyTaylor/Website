<p> I created this website so others could easily find and make use of my research as well as the code I have written and datasets I have collected. The site is broken into the following sections:
</p>
<b> Publications: </b>  All the papers I have contributed to during the coarse of my PhD.<br><br>
<b> Datasets: </b> Datasets I have collected that have been approved for public release. Currently this only contains one dataset of the ACFR gathered with a lidar and hyperspectral camera, however I hope to soon add an inferred camera dataset.<br><br>
<b> Code: </b> A collection of Matlab, C++ and CUDA functions I have written for testing my alignment techniques as well as several of the most common techniques I have found in literature.<br><br>

  <h2>My Research </h2>
</div>
<p> Since 2012 I have been performing research into the alignment and calibration of multimodal sensors. The techniques I have developed however are not sensor specific and can be easily adapted to suit a range of 2D and 3D sensors and applications.
Recently I have begun looking into the methods for calibrating mobile robotic systems</p>
<p> A few examples of my research and its applications is shown in the images below.</p><br><br>
