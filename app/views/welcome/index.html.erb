<p> I created this website so others could easily find and make use of my research as well as the code I have written and datasets I have collected. The site is broken into the following sections:
</p>
<b> <%= link_to 'Publications:','/publications' %> </b>  All the papers I have contributed to during the course of my PhD.<br><br>
<b> <%= link_to 'Arm Calibration:','/arm-cal' %> </b>  A simple robotic arm to camera calibration method.<br><br>
<b> <%= link_to 'Code:','/code' %> </b> A collection of Matlab, C++ and CUDA functions I have written for testing my alignment techniques as well as several of the most common techniques I have found in literature.<br><br>
<b> <%= link_to 'Datasets:','/datasets' %> </b> Datasets I have collected that have been approved for public release. Currently this only contains one dataset of the ACFR gathered with a lidar and hyperspectral camera, however I hope to soon add an inferred camera dataset.<br><br>
<b> <%= link_to 'Non-academic:','/nonacademic' %> </b> All the stuff I feel like sticking on the site that has nothing to do with my research.<br><br>

  <h2>My Research </h2>
</div>
<p> Since 2012 I have been performing research into the alignment and calibration of multimodal sensors. The techniques I have developed however are not sensor specific and can be easily adapted to suit a range of 2D and 3D sensors and applications.
Recently I have begun looking into the methods for calibrating mobile robotic systems</p>
<p> A few examples of my research and its applications is shown in the images below.</p><br><br>
